                A mother wraps her love around the heart of her daughter, keeping each beat steady through the rhythm of life, until wings take shape, and it&#039;s time for short mother&#039;s day poem for mom roses are red, voilets are blue, sugar is sweet, and so are you! Mother poems can celebrate a mother who believes in being a parent, rather than just a friend, as mother poems often show appreciation to mom. Our teacher introduced the collection to us in class, the poems were really good and the only part i really remember is her speaking of the little boy&#039;s art project he had made for her by cementing his hands and painting it.
