    <h3>She had a weakness for his hand on her neck and his words in her heart.</h3>
    <p>She loved to spend rainy afternoons lost in thought, her hand daydreaming beneath the fabric of her. The words of a love poem speak the desire, passion, and it can make the person feel in such a way which he will never experience before. Roses are red, violets are…i guess i should leave the love poems to the experts. Any act that helps a couple feel that they are more than roommates and that reminds them of the special feelings that they hold for each other deep inside is a romantic gesture.</p>
