                Here&#039;s me pretending i was there.ðŸ¤ª i love you @spotify ! His poetry is distinctly modern, and although he was influenced by surrealist poetry, his lyricism and intense emotion have more in common with the romantics than this. At the time of writing, it had more than 12 million views on youtube.

    <h3>As turk says in the video, look up from your phone, shut down the display.</h3>
