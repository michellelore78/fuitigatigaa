    <h3>Having no friends, feeling unloved and feeling all alone.</h3>
    <p>Poems awaken the dormant soul in us. She never cries, just stares blankly alone in her room, with music playing she craves his touch, the feeling&#039;s to much she grips the blade blood drips from her body as she sighs in relief the mess on the floor are signs of a thief depression and anxiety has settled in she fights a battle she thinks she. Roses are red, violets areâ€¦i guess i should leave the love poems to the experts. There are some millionaires with money they can&#039;t use their wives run round like banshees their children sing the blues they&#039;ve got expensive doctors to cure their alone, all alone nobody, but nobody can make it out here alone.</p>
