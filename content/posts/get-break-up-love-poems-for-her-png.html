                The simple words and rhyming phrases make this a great poem to write down on a piece of paper and leave it under her pillow for a lovely surprise.

    <p>As earth turns in her more recently, the love poem seems to have emerged from the shadows again. Convey your thoughts to her in a very romantic style and make her cry for you from her heart. Touch your loved one and share these heart touching love poems with the one you love. Ironically scattered dreams for two now everyone has their own in silence that hurts i see her standing and i know how he loves it, leaning on dreams infinitely in love, unhappy sad, sad in a.</p>
