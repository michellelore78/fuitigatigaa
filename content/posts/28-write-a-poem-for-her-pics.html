    <p><strong>28+ Write A Poem For Her Pics</strong>. What she doesnt know is that the last time i wrote a poem. I wanted to write a poem for her, you know, to catch her heart in just a blur… one that can touch her heart… and that definitely is the hardest part… they say i must think of her as i write… think what words she might like… but my mind flies just by thinking of her smile… damn, this is just not right!!</p>

                Louise was forced to give up playing the violin to avoid damaging her joints, and given pain killer drugs, which she still takes.

The moon has a face like the clock in the hall, she i think that i shall never see a poem lovely as a tree.
