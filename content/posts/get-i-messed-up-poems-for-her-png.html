                This poem for mom thanks her for all she&#039;s done for you. The poem describes the lack of humanity ,,,,so never judge anyone because we don&#039;t have the right to judge anyone , so stop discriminating others by their colour , caste , body shape etc. May you have an impact on people&#039;s lives as you have mine.
