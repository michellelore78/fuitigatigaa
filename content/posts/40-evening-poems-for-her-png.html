                On late winter days, when the spring is closer and closer, with every more and more confident sun ray, every lighter and longer evening, people&#039;s hearts are awaken with the eternal hunger of love, affection and tenderness. Every relationship has to face troubles and difficulties in life but it does not mean that it is an end of a relationship. You are the only reason i am happy, even when i am sad, i know there is someone there for me.

    <h3>Give her my poems to read in bed stopping by woods on a snowy evening by robert frost (audio).</h3>
    <p>Wake her up to a romantic poem. Words have a particular power known to rally soldiers to victory, heal broken hearts, drive nations to madness and even put someone to sleep! Few of them are short and others are medium to long in length. The anactoria poem is her most famous, though i have to say i also have a major soft spot for this fragment, translated by anne carson i mean, i am so hip even my errors are correct should probably be your mantra.</p>
